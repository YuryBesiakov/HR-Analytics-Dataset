# HR-Analytics-Dataset
📊 Employee Attrition Prediction

📌 Project Overview
This project explores the HR Analytics Dashboard - Employee Attrition dataset from Kaggle (link) to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

🎯 Objective
Analyze employee demographic and HR data to understand patterns related to attrition.

Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict attrition.

Gain actionable insights that can help HR teams reduce employee turnover.

🗂️ Dataset
Source: Kaggle HR Analytics Dashboard - Employee Attrition

Rows/Columns: (Add the count after EDA)

Target variable: Attrition (Yes/No)

🔍 Project Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data types, missing values, empty strings

Distributions, correlations, and trends

Visualizations: attrition by department, age, salary, etc.

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values/blanks

Encode categorical variables

Feature scaling & selection

Modeling

Baseline models: Logistic Regression

Advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost

Model comparison: accuracy, F1-score, ROC curve

Insights

Which features most influence attrition?

How can HR teams act on these insights?

✅ Key Results
Best model: (e.g., XGBoost with 85% accuracy)

Top features: (e.g., JobRole, OverTime, MonthlyIncome)
